<h2 id="this-is-why-i-run-c25k:b8483abfa47fe35ce2582e628562e321">This is why I run: C25K</h2>

<p>This race is my destiny. I finished C25K four years ago, now I just need to take the &ldquo;5&rdquo; out and run the C2K. I dream about running Coast to Kosciuszko, it&rsquo;s what inspires me to run every day. Watch this space for 2012. View the trailer for &ldquo;Coast to Kosciuszko: A portrait of an Ultramarathon&rdquo; and be inspired.

If you want to find out what running can mean to someone, read this. If you have trouble getting out of bed at any time to go for a run, remember reading this. If you&rsquo;re hurting during your run and feel like stopping, remember reading this. If you ever get injured because of running, read this again. Jenny posts at the Runners World forum, she has inspired me and countless others during her battle. Thanks Jenny for letting me publish your story here.</p>

<h2 id="a-common-question-why-do-people-drop-out-during-c25k:b8483abfa47fe35ce2582e628562e321">A common question: why do people drop out during C25K?</h2>

<p>On a forum I contribute to, someone asked:&rdquo; I&rsquo;m interested to know if those who have started this previously and got to week 3 or 4 had to stop because of injury or it got too hard or life just got in the way?&rdquo; I have also seen this sort of question in other C25K forums. Here was my reply on the forum in question.</p>

<p>Great motivational piece from our friends at Nike.</p>

<p>Imagine being told you can&rsquo;t donate your kidney to your very sick daughter because of your weight.</p>

<h2 id="the-pre-dawn-people:b8483abfa47fe35ce2582e628562e321">The Pre-Dawn People</h2>

<p>Journalist Dana Marytin meets a running group, the pre-dawn people. This story really captures what running can bring to you life, and why you keep running years after finishing the C25K. I have two of my own &ldquo;Pre-Dawn People&rdquo; groups I run with, and the relationships I have made are just as close as Dana describes in this great story.</p>
